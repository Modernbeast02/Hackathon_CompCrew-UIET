Welcome To Medonate!!

This is the platform where you can volunteer to donate  medicines which are not in use to those who can't afford them or are in dire need of them.
Apart from this , you can also contribute by  donating  blood. Every year, medicines worth billions of dollars get expired. 
This platform is especially designed for hapless people  who need medicines or blood and they can easily connect to those who are willing to donate. Even if a few patients get Medonate's benefit, its purpose would be fulfilled!!

Future :
1.) Connecting Donor and Receiver by a chatting interface. </br>
2.) Maintaining a feedback system where receiver will rate the donor if he was genuine or not in order to reduce risk of malpractices.
